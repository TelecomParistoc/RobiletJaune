# GrobotControl
There are three files in this repository:
 * main_Grobot.py: contains the top level actions
 * structure_Grobot.py: contains the construction of the object robot, which is used in main_Grobot.py
 * python_install_everything: script to automatically install or reinstall all our libraries the robot uses. Make sure this script works fine! (it's hard to know if something has been forgotten)
